Feature: Dynamic dependency

  Scenario: Use a dyndep file
    Given a file named "build.ninja" with:
      """
      rule cp
        command = cp $in $out
      rule dd
        command = echo ok && echo ninja_dyndep_version = 1 >> $out && echo build foo: dyndep >> $out

      build foo: cp bar || foo.dd
        dyndep = foo.dd
      build foo.dd: dd

      """
    And a file named "bar" with ""
    When I successfully run `turtle`
    Then the stdout should contain exactly "ok"

  Scenario: Use a dyndep file with an addtional input
    Given a file named "build.ninja" with:
      """
      rule touch
        command = touch $out
      rule cp
        command = echo ok && cp $in $out
      rule dd
        command = echo ninja_dyndep_version = 1 >> $out && echo build foo: dyndep '|' bar >> $out

      build foo: touch || foo.dd
        dyndep = foo.dd
      build foo.dd: dd
      build bar: cp baz

      """
    And a file named "baz" with ""
    When I successfully run `turtle`
    Then the stdout should contain exactly "ok"
