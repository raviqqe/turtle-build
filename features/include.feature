  Scenario: Use a variable in a child build file
    Given a file named "build.ninja" with:
      """
      include foo.ninja

      rule echo
        command = echo $x

      build foo: echo

      """
    And a file named "foo.ninja" with:
      """
      x = hello

      """
    When I successfully run `turtle`
    Then the stdout should contain exactly "hello"
